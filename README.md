# Amazon-Review-Classification-using-KNN-Classifier
Implemented a k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier to predict the sentiment for 18506 baby product reviews provided in the test file. Positive sentiment is represented by a review rating of +1 and negative sentiment is represented by a review rating of -1.

Training data consists of 18506 reviews as well, provided in the file train.dat. Each row begins with the sentiment score followed by the text associated with that rating.

# The objective of this assignment are the following:

* Implement the Nearest Neighbor Classification algorithm
* Handle text data (reviews of Amazon baby products)
* Design and engineer features from text data.
* Choose the best model, i.e., parameters of a nearest neighbor classifier, features and similarity functions
